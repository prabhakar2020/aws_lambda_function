# AWS Lambda Function

 - The code we run on AWS Lambda is called a **Lambda function**. After we create Lambda function it is always ready to run as soon as it is triggered, similar to a formula in a spreadsheet. 
 - Each lambda function includes our code as well as some associated configuration information, including the function names and resource requirements.
 - AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs our code when events are triggered and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. 
 - We can use AWS Lambda functions to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create our own backend services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. 
 - AWS Lambda can automatically run code in response to multiple events, such as HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, modifications to objects in Amazon S3 buckets, EC2 updates, triggering the deployments and etc.

In this example, we are going talk about - 
 1. [S3 delete data as soon as data uploaded on S3 bucket](s3_delete_data)
 1. [Copy source S3 data to target S3 bucket as soon as data uploaded on Source S3 bucket](s3_copy_data)
